                    This site was designed by <strong>AI</strong>, inspired by my resume, and is self-hosted on an old MacBook Pro (circa 2011) running nginx in a docker container.

                    I was inspired to self-host when taking linux networking classes, and achieved this through a static IP reservation on the router with NAT forwarding.

                    Lovable originally wanted to make this a react site, but a static html can be served <strong>20x faster</strong>, and who in the world needs a portfolio site to be dynamically generated on the fly.
